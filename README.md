2D bimodal microstructure (a coarse grain includes in a matrix fine grains)
hello, I tried to generate a simple 2D bimodal microstructure (a coarse grain includes in a matrix fine grains) as shown in the image below. I managed to generate the fine grain matrix from the positions.txt and weight.txt files (all the files are attached) but I could not place the coarse grain in the matrix and remove the fine grains correspondents.
